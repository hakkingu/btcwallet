Just a simple btc wallet generator~

First of all, all you need to do is install nodeJS in your system:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After that, you must go into your vscode (or whatever source code editor that you would like to use), and then open your terminal. 

CHECK IF YOUR NODEJS IS INSTALLED
node -v 

ALSO, USE THAT FOR NPM AS WELL!
npm -v 

SETTING UP:
Now, type in your terminal: npm init 

AFTER THAT: 
npm install bip39 bip32@2.0.6 bitcoinjs-lib

Now, just create a folder called "src", and then put your .js file in there. 

You're good to go now.
Check my createWallet.js to further instructions.
