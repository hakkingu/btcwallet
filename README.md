Just a simple btc wallet generator~

First of all, all you need to do is install nodeJS in your system:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After that, you must go into your vscode (or whatever source code editor that you would like to use), and then open your terminal. 

-CHECK IF YOUR NODEJS IS INSTALLED

node -v 

-ALSO, USE THAT FOR NPM AS WELL!

npm -v 

-SETTING UP:

Now, type in your terminal: npm init 

-AFTER THAT: 

npm install bip39  bip32@2.0.6  bitcoinjs-lib

Now, just create a folder called "src", and then put your .js file in there. 

You're good to go now.
